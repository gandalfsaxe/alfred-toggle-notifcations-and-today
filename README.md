Suggested shortcuts:

* Show Notifications Center: ⌥⌘←   _(default: none)_
* This workflow: ⌥⌘→

The first can be set in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Mission Control -> Show Notifications Center (same as swipe in from right side of the trackpad).

Forked from [this](https://www.packal.org/workflow/toggle-today-and-notification-center-views) workflow, which didn't work for me out-of-the-box, and also get 404 on GitHub link and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/f3p24z/hi_all_is_there_any_keyboard_shortcut_that_can/fhk99u9/) reddit post.
